# DnDUtilitySite
This is a personal project for me to get more involved with Bootstrap and ASP.NET. I did Bootstrap at a recent hackathon UAH-ACM did and really fell in love with it. So I decided to combine that new love with my love of C# and create a website that holds a lot of common Dungeon and Dragon utility functions.

I expect to first get Character Sheets completed, then I'll move onto loading and saving them (probably locally), then after that, I'll work on smaller utilty functions like dice rolling. Maybe do some character creation or encounter generation for a later sub-project?
